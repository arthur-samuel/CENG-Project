Project Title: Early Diabetes Detection in Nkwabeng North Municipality

Overview:
This CENG (Engineering in Community) project, conducted in collaboration with the Sunyani Regional Hospital, aims to address the pressing issue of diabetes in the Nkwabeng North Municipality. Leveraging Continuous Glucose Monitoring System (CGMS) technology, our project focuses on the early detection of diabetes to facilitate timely intervention and improve the overall health outcomes of the community.

Objectives:
Early Detection:

Utilize CGMS for real-time monitoring of glucose levels in community members.
Identify early signs of diabetes through data analysis and pattern recognition.
Community Collaboration:

Work closely with healthcare professionals at the Sunyani Regional Hospital.
Engage with the Nkwabeng North Municipality community for feedback and involvement.
Education and Awareness:

Conduct workshops and awareness campaigns on the importance of early diabetes detection.
Empower community members with knowledge on healthy lifestyle choices.
Features:
CGMS Integration:

Seamless integration with a variety of CGMS devices.
Reliable and secure data transmission from CGMS devices to the system.
Data Analysis Algorithms:

Implement machine learning algorithms to analyze glucose patterns.
Early detection algorithms for prompt identification of potential diabetes cases.
User-Friendly Dashboard:

Intuitive web-based interface for users to monitor their glucose trends.
Personalized alerts and recommendations based on analyzed data.

Community Impact:
Improved health outcomes through early detection and intervention.
Empowered community members with knowledge and tools for self-care.
Strengthened collaboration between engineering students, healthcare professionals, and the local community.

Technologies Used:
Python for backend data processing and analysis.
Machine learning libraries for pattern recognition.
